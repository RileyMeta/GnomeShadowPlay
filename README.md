# GnomeShadowPlay
A Gnome and GTK 3.0 style Shadowplay replacement that uses primarily Python.

## What this is
A GTK and Python wrapper that uses [GPU-Screen-Recorder](https://git.dec05eba.com/gpu-screen-recorder/about/) to mimic a near one-to-one linux-implimentation of Nvidia ShadowPlay or AMD Adrenalin.
